Magic Passwords README
======================

Even bigger issue is not power of cryptographic algorithm, but strength of password. Unfortunately good password you can generate as totally random or write it as eg. first letters from your favorite sentence. However more often, even banks recommend you regular password changing.
Because it is difficult to make at once or even immediately, good password i try to meet this need. Magic Passwords software enables you transform very simple password (legendary '123456') into much stronger passphrase which looks like random letter and digits contained string.
How it works?? You need type to program 'easy' password, set up parameters as count of uppercase letters, iterations number and copy to clipboard by pressing 'Copy to clipboard' button, and at now you can paste it to proper field.

Trackbars in program:
---------------------

Upper letters count - first letters will be uppercase. Of course you can't type 'uppercase digit', but letter - you can. All changes of this property affect to password generating process in case iterations count bigger than 1.
Iterations count - password generating algorithm is based on hashing process, and it is sensitive to letter's case. If you use minimum one uppercase letter, it give you totally different, another set of char in password than lower letter! Additionally iterations count mean count of hashing loops.
Length of password - usually less important property, but if your password is too long - you may need to trim it to required length. Property has no affect on password generating process, and it only trim result.

Checkboxes in program:
----------------------

Show - for security reason your typed and generated passwords are hidden under "#" sign. If you want see those passwords, you can check adequate checkbox for this. Activating this checkboxes are not recommended in using in places like Internet cafe.

Buttons:

Copy to clipboard - copies generated password to clipboard.
About - info about program and author.

Donations:
----------

If you think it program is needed, you can send some bitcoins (may be even mBTC). You may send donation to address:

Perfect Money, and PayPal donations are also supported. PayPal has strange income policy, so i request all donors (as all) to donate via PayPal not frequent as ten times a day.
